# BeginnerPythonPractice

## The repo is being creates as I follow along with the following course:

### https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

## Dr. Angela Yu is an excellent instructor and I highly suggest getting her course

## The material in this repo is only similar to her instruction, not a copy.

## It could be seen as examples of the material I learned through her course

## but certainly not a replacement for her excellent explanations of the material!

## This repo is a work-in-progress as I work through learning Python where I will include:

### 1. Useful simple code snippets for beginners to learn from.

### 2. Increasingly difficult code as the "day" number increases.
