### This code simply swaps values so the input for a outputs on b and b on a
### This is achieved by swapping values as explained below:
### a>c, b>a, c>b

### The value of "a" is temporarily stored in "c" so the value stored in "b" can then be moved to "a"
### Once that is complete, we can move the value of "c" into variable "b"

### We simply use "c" as temporary storage so we can swap the values of "a" and "b"
